# Practical implementations of Kubernetes network policies using Calico to secure pod-to-pod communication


# Kubernetes Network Policies with Calico:
Kubernetes Network Policies provide a robust mechanism to control the communication between pods and other network endpoints. They are essential for securing your applications by defining rules that specify how pods can communicate with each other and other network resources. In this hands-on repo, we will cover the fundamentals and demonstrate how to implement network policies with a practical example involving pods in **three namespaces** i.e **dev, qa and prod**.

# Understanding Network Policies:
Network Policies are implemented using Kubernetes resources that define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. They use labels to select pods and define rules for ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic.
Key Concepts:

•	**Pod Selector**: Selects the group of pods to which the policy applies. \
•	**Ingress Rules**: Define allowed incoming traffic. \
•	**Egress Rules**: Define allowed outgoing traffic. \
•	**Policy Types**: Can be either ingress, egress, or both.


# Features:

•	**Namespace Isolation**: Policies to isolate network traffic within specific namespaces, preventing unintended access between different parts of the cluster. \
•	**Granular Traffic Control**: Define rules that allow or block traffic between namespaces, ensuring that only authorized communication paths are permitted. \
•	**Environment Segmentation**: Securely manage traffic flow between development, QA, and production environments, helping to maintain a strict separation of concerns. \
•	**Ingress and Egress Management**: Control incoming and outgoing traffic at a fine-grained level, which is crucial for both security and performance optimization. \
•	**Port-Specific Rules**: Implement policies that allow or restrict traffic on specific TCP/UDP ports, such as allowing QA to communicate with production over a specific port.


# Files Included:
1.	**deny-traffic-inside-namespace.yaml**
o	Denies all traffic within a specific namespace, ensuring strict isolation.
2.	**Creating-ns-pods-labels.yaml**
o	Creates namespaces and applies necessary labels to pods for easier policy application.
3.	**block-all-traffic-namespace.yaml**
o	Blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic to and from a specific namespace, providing a secure baseline.
4.	**Allow-Traffic-single-namespace.yaml**
o	Allows internal traffic within a single namespace, enabling services within the namespace to communicate freely.
5.	**allow-dev-to-prod-traffic.yaml**
o	Permits traffic from the development namespace to the production namespace under controlled conditions.
6.	**allow-prod-to-qa-tcp-8888.yaml**
o	Allows communication from production to QA namespace over TCP port 8888, ensuring specific services can interact.
7.	**allowing-coredns-ingress-prod.yaml**
o	Allows ingress traffic to CoreDNS in the production namespace, ensuring that DNS services remain accessible.
